## Welcome to my documentation portfolio!

This section of my **Docs-as-Code portfolio** provides a comprehensive look at technical documentation samples, all authored and published entirely in Markdown using Docusaurus. Here you'll find examples of developer guides, API references, and insights into the workflows used to create them.

## Navigation
**Guides**
- [Installing and Applying a Theme to Google Chrome](/docs/google-chrome-theme-installation)
- [Using Postman to Connect to the Stripe API](/docs/stripe-api/using-postman)
- [Microsoft Word to GitHub Wiki Workflow with Writage](/docs/word-github-wiki-writage)
- [Route Cloud Application Logs Into a Pipeline](/docs/data-pipelines/route-cloud-app-logs-guide)

**API References**
- [Stripe API Documentation Sample](/docs/stripe-api/stripe-api)
- [Pet Store API Documentation Sample](/docs/pet-store-api/)
- [Ingest Events Using the Streaming Ingest API](/docs/data-pipelines/api-ingest-stream)

**Conceptual/Overview Docs**
- [Event Streams & Observability Pipelines](/docs/data-pipelines/concept-observability-pipelines)
- [Before You Begin](/docs/data-pipelines/before-you-begin)

**Workflows**
- Drafting with Markdown in VS Code
- Markdown linting with Vale
- Docs versioning with Git
- API validation with Postman and Swagger/OpenAPI
- Publishing with Docusaurus

## Tools
- **Docusaurus**: For generating the static site and documentation.
- **VS Code**: Primary editor for all content.
- **Postman**: For API testing and generating API documentation examples.
- **Vale**: For linting and ensuring style guide adherence.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control and hosting.

This mirrors how professional teams maintain developer documentation portals such as Docusaurus or similar static-site generators.

> Each sample demonstrates end-to-end doc creation: research → drafting → review → publishing.
